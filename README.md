# EZClip

<h1>Windows Application for copying/pasting</h1>

EZClip is a small project made to play with Visual C#.
Acts as an array of size 5 which can be filled like Windows Clipboard.

Also uses Windows Hotkeys for ease of use similar to what Ctrl+C and V does.

Use Ctrl+[1-5] to select one of the 5 containers to autocopy.
